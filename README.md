# The Drive

This personal project was created as a way to track player data when playing Fantasy Basketball.

## Information

Front End `in progress` - Being built with Styled Components, React Icons, React Router, and Axios.
Back End `in progress` - I intend on building the back end with ExpressJS and NodeJS.
Web Crawler - Built with Python using Beautiful Soup and NumPy. 
Database `in progress` - I intend on building the database with MongoDB.

## Data
The data is sourced from Basketball Reference (https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and stored in MongoDB to prevent abuse.

## History
I intend on updating the history once the barebones project is complete.
